Iaas: Infrastructure as service: Dynamic allocation of computational resources. So the user can utilize the resources (VM, Storage, Network)as requirement. Elasticity and extendibility.    (Convenient and cost-friendly)





is hadoop an open source framework to create the coordination services?

* No, **Hadoop** is not primarily designed to create coordination services. Instead, Hadoop is an **open-source framework** for **distributed storage and processing** of large datasets using the **MapReduce programming model**. It allows the processing of large amounts of data across clusters of computers using simple programming models.



Batch Processing: (Not real-time)

## III. Virtualization

A. Virtual Machine 

A *virtual machine* is a software-defined computer that runs on a physical computer with a separate operating system and computing resources. The physical computer is called the *host machine* and virtual machines are *guest machines*. Multiple virtual machines can run on a single physical machine. Virtual machines are abstracted from the computer hardware by a hypervisor.
